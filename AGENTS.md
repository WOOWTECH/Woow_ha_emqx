# AGENTS.md

Rules for every agent and person who changes this repository. The full
release mechanism is described in the Woow_HA_App_Store README (section
"版本策略與同步") and in ADR-0005 of the WOOW addon pipeline.

1. **``main`` only changes through a pull request.** A ruleset blocks direct
   pushes, force pushes and deleting the branch, and nobody can bypass it.
   Push a branch, open a PR, wait for the required checks, then merge.
2. **A PR that changes an addon version is a release.** Merging it publishes
   that version to the WOOW App Store. It must pass every required check; the
   checks are the approval, there is no human review step. Every PR runs
   `Upgrade comparison / compare` (pipeline #89); treat a failure as blocking.
   It compares each addon whose version the PR changes with the latest Stable
   Release. A PR that changes no version passes it in seconds. The result is
   in the job summary. It also runs the upgrade test (pipeline #144): the Store
   rebuilds the latest Release and the PR for amd64, starts the Release under a
   mock Supervisor, then the PR's version on the same data, and fails when
   either does not start (here: the watchdog `/api/v5/status` on port 18083
   answers and the container stays up). Because of `host_network: true`, the
   test runs the addon in the runner's host network namespace, as Supervisor
   does, so `[HOST]` is the bridge gateway `172.30.32.1` (pipeline #158).
   Without a `verify` hook it checks startup only, not data. To check data,
   add hooks in `emqx/upgrade-check/`: `seed` writes data on the old version,
   `verify` checks it on this PR's version. Their interface (environment, JSON
   report) is in the Woow_HA_App_Store README, "第 2 類 升級測試", paragraph
   "資料檢查（#138）". Keep the hooks executable (`git update-index
   --chmod=+x`), with LF endings and a `#!` of python3 or busybox sh only (no
   bash): they run in the Store's python:3.12-alpine mock Supervisor
   container, so never `docker run` from them. A hook must not leave
   background processes running when it exits, and a hook file must not be a
   symlink to anything outside `upgrade-check/` (only that directory is
   mounted). An optional `emqx/upgrade-check/settings.yaml` sets
   `startup_timeout`, `stable_seconds` and `hook_timeout` (positive integer
   seconds); `hook_timeout` defaults to 600 and covers the whole `docker exec`
   of a hook.
3. **Breaking changes must be declared in `upgrade-notes.yaml`** next to the
   addon's `config.yaml` (here `emqx/upgrade-notes.yaml`). Create the file
   only when the upgrade comparison asks for it; copy `change` and `key` from
   its report and write the migration path. The addons here are built on the
   device, so the vulnerability comparison does not run for them yet (pipeline
   #90). The release puts these entries on the GitHub Release. Rules, change
   names and the file format: the Woow_HA_App_Store README, section
   "升版比對與 `upgrade-notes.yaml`".
